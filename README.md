Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a fundamental method in linear regression used to estimate the relationship between independent variables (predictors) and a dependent variable (outcome). The goal of OLS is to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values from the model.

I implemented it on excel so everyone can easly understand it.
